<h1>Cracking the OSCP Code: A Journey from Learning to Certified Success</h1>


Hello guys, Myself Arpit Waghmare it’s my first ever blog, please share your feedback in comments.

<b>Getting started before OSCP:</b> I started my journey by starting with hack the box. Here, I solved starting point section all free labs which helped me to understand basics.

<b>Approaching to OSCP:</b> After buying OSCP I directly stepped into 12 week learning plan, for reference here is the link(https://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/19289801867412) . In my case I bought additional 1 month subscription to solve challenge labs. In starting chapters, it is mentioned how to approach the content of this course which I followed and it made me easier to understand concepts. In this process, I took notes from every chapter which helped me to solve the challenge labs.
<b>Preparation for Exams:</b> Solving challenge labs made me understand the different scenario’s about how to approach things in enumeration and exploitation part. After that I took a mock test from challenge labs to test myself where it looks easier for me to pass the exam. But in this period of time, I heard from one of my friends that he failed in his 1st attempt, So I thought I need to do more practice as it’s not enough what I did till now, I bought proving grounds subscription and started practicing where I solved all easy machines at first and kept increasing level as I boost my confidence.


<b>Final EXAM:</b> At this stage I scheduled exam which is in just 6 days, the exam I scheduled awaits, a countdown filled with anticipation and dedicated preparation. In this period of time, I made a report template ready for exam(https://www.offsec.com/pwk-online/OSCP-Exam-Report.docx). 

<b>After EXAM:</b> Now after exam, I was confident that I will pass the Exam. It took 5 days to get my result till this time, I got so nervous while opening the mail but at the end I was so happy when I read, that I have completed the certification successfully no more words to express the feeling.

The final thing, I just want to say thanks to all who helped me throughout this journey.
